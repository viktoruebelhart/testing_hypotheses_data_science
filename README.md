In this project we will work with hypotheses to answer our clients' questions. There will be some cases to be analyzed.

Case 1: The lamp industry hired us! And a new check on the indications was carried out, collecting the duration of other indications, 
we already know that we can infer and draw conclusions from this sample. We are informed that the average duration of this new experiment was **1200 hours.**

Case 2: A software company is interested in checking whether the average response time of its technical support is **less than 30 minutes**, as promised in the service level agreement (SLA). 
They collect data on response times for a sample of 25 support requests.

Christmas bulbs is equal to or different from 1570 hours.
